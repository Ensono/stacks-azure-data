=== Networking

Using a private network is the default behaviour in the Ensono Stacks Data Azure Platform. The networking subfolder contains configurations for the created network and subnetworks, at its core using azurerm-hub-spoke Ensono Stacks Terraform module. See Microsoft documentation for more details on implementing Hub-spoke network topology in Azure.
