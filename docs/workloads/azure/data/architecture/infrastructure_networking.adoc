== Infrastructure & Networking

All of the core data platform resources are defined using Terraform. The templates are grouped into two sub-folders within the deploy/azure directory:

* `infra` - deploys Azure Databricks and associated components for Data pipelines
* `networking` - deploys the private networks, if required, to run the pipelines in a secure manner.
