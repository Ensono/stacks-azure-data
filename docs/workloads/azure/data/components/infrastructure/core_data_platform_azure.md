# Infrastructure - TODO

Documentation on the Infrastructure used and (maybe) the high level deployment approach.
Deployment details (usage manual, CLI commands) should be captured in
[getting_started](../../getting_started/core_data_platform_deployment_azure.md).

This should be an extension to [intro_data_azure.md](../../intro_data_azure.md).

**TODO**: elaborate
### Infrastructure deployed
* Resource Group
* Azure Data Factory
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
* Azure Blob Storage (for config files)
* Azure Key Vault
* Log Analytics Workspace
* Databricks Workspace
  * Azure Key Vault-backed secret scope

+ Networking, VNet, any additional security info
